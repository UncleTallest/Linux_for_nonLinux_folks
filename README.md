I seem to spend a considerable amount of time on occasion fixing and/or explaining how to fix Linux for my less knowledgeable friends. Trust me when I say, it is not that these folks aren't smart enough to use Linux properly. There are just so many ways you can literally shoot yourself in the foot with any operating system; Linux just gives you the complete toolkit to do said shooting and says "Go have fun!", normally without any safety mechanisms in place to keep you from harm. 

This set of documents is my attempt to give you advice so you can take care of most of these things on your own without angering your old neckbeard friends who seem to  do this stuff in their sleep. I fully anticipate some of you to keep asking for my help. but think of these documents as a first step in the process. Who knows, you might learn something useful in here. :smirk:
